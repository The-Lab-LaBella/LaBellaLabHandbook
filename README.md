This handbook outlines the expectations of all members of the LaBella lab. It is a living document that will be continually updated
LaBella Lab Manual 

1.	Introduction
Welcome to the brand-new LaBella Lab! This manual is a living document that is designed to ensure an equitable and productive lab environment. I am always open to suggestions and I will be happy to discuss any aspect of this document with you directly. You are required to read this document, in its entirety, prior to joining the lab. This ensures that you know what to expect from me and know what is expected from you. 
This document has been modeled after the following exceptional examples and will be updated with university resources. Other lab manuals: https://github.com/memobc/memolab-manual http://jpeelle.net/peellelab_manual.pdf https://github.com/alylab/labmanual

2.	Expectations 
Above all else, everyone in the lab will treat each other with respect and dignity. Everyone will pursue science with integrity in an ethical manner. We can all work towards a positive, thought-provoking, equitable and rewarding lab together by prioritizing the items below.  

2.1.	 Big Picture

	Do science you are proud to share with your chosen family and friends. If you don’t feel that way, we can work together to find a solution. 

	Do science with care and attention. Your work will eventually join the collective knowledge of science and is worth checking and double checking.

	Mistakes happen. Alert those you are working with immediately and start thinking of solutions. 

	Do your science. You are the main driver of your projects and are expected to work independently when possible. 

	Collaborate with other members. Science is collaborative and you should be open and willing to share your expertise with others in the lab. This does not mean doing their projects for them. 

	Keep a work-life balance. This can be especially difficult in science because you will have very demanding weeks (leading up to publications or defenses) and you will have slower weeks (data running). A work-life balance should be achieved over time. 

	This is a job. You are expected to treat this position with the respect you would any other position. You are also expected to separate yourself from your work. 

	Communicate. You should expect me to communicate clear expectations of your work. You should communicate your needs, concerns, and progress with me. 

	You are a person. Life happens. If you need additional resources or need to discuss a leave from lab please communicate with me as soon as you can.

	Your goals will be respected. We will support and respect your career goals regardless of the field you want to work in. 

2.2.	Small Picture
	If you are sick, stay home! We share lab spaces with each other and with other groups. If you are not feeling well you should stay home and let me know you will not be in lab. 

	Take your vacation. The university has clear guidelines on vacation time for staff and graduate students (link here). Please give me at least 2 weeks’ notice of planned vacation time. 

	Clean up after yourself. You are expected to keep a neat and clean workspace. You are also expected to dispose of food and beverages in a timely manner. 

	Use the calendar. Before asking when or where an event is, please check the lab calendar (link here)

	No strong perfume, colognes, moisturizer etc. Be respectful that your coworkers may have different tastes or sensitivity when it comes to smells. 

	What you wear is up to you. You are free to express yourself and wear what you wish in lab. There are contexts where I would advise a more professional wardrobe and I am open to discussing this with you. 

2.3.	Communication

	Respond to your emails in a timely manner. Everyone is expected to respond to emails within two “business days” unless you are traveling or on vacation. 

	Requests for one-on-one meetings with the PI will be scheduled, in person or via zoom, within two weeks of a request. 

	Slack communication is important. Slack is an important way to communicate with members of the lab. Important items, however, like requests for recommendations should always be communicated via email. 

2.4.	PI

	Provide a clear vision of the overall goals of the lab.

	Apply for and secure funding to support all members.

	Develop independent research projects for lab members that align with their goals and interests. 

	Meet regularly with lab members to discuss goals, projects, progress and wellbeing. Regularly is at least twice a year and can be as often as once a month if needed.

	Support your
